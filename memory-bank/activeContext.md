# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Navigation tweaks delivered (home-first BottomNav order + removal of breadcrumb header). Monitor feedback or follow-up requests.
- Backend CORS now explicitly allows the deployed GitHub Pages origin plus dev hosts to prevent upload “Network Error” reports.

## Recent Notes
- Playback hooks/components already stable; shell now keeps content minimal with only BottomNav visible.
- Fly config now sets `FRONTEND_URL=https://jacixn.github.io/INKAMI` and supports optional `EXTRA_CORS_ORIGINS` for future origins.

## Next Steps
1. Verify new nav order and styling across breakpoints once QA assets available.
2. Field any new UX adjustments or branding asks for the shell/nav area.
