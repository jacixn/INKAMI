# Product Context

## Problem
Fans rely on fan-made scans or raw manga chapters that require heavy reading focus. Traditional readers lack immersive audio or adaptive assistance, making long sessions tiring and inaccessible to visually impaired readers.

## Solution Overview
INKAMI streamlines chapter ingestion and narrates every bubble with suitable voices. Users upload chapters, wait for automated processing, then consume content through an immersive canvas that highlights text in sync with audio.

## Target Users
- Manga/manhwa enthusiasts wanting audiobook-like experiences.
- Creators/scanlators showcasing dubbed previews.
- Accessibility-focused readers who benefit from narration + visual cues.

## Experience Goals
- Upload-to-listen flow should feel like a single cohesive wizard.
- Processing feedback must reassure users (progress, statuses, errors).
- Reader UI should spotlight artwork while keeping controls minimal.
- Allow future refinements (speaker corrections, re-voicing) without re-uploading.
