# Cursor Rules

- Always consult `memory-bank/` documents before making changes.
- Web app leans on Tailwind and App Router; prefer modifying shared components (`AppShell`, `BottomNav`) rather than duplicating layout logic.
- Respect static export constraints: avoid server-only APIs in client components unless guarded.
- Use absolute paths for tool commands as per user preference.
